3. Contributing:
----------------
ml is intended to be an educational project. Therefore, code clarity will always
take precedence over execution speed, binary size, and programming style.

In that vein, instead of contributing to ml, you should use ml as inspiration
and implement your own ls-like utility.

If you really want to contribute to ml, I am not going to stop you however. After
making sure that your changes conform to the ml vision (code clarity above all)
submit a pull request via Github.
