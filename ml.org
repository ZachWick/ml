* BUGS
** TODO line wrapping/breaking at screen edge
Don't rely on the terminal to wrap/break as needed. Determine how wide
the terminal is and pretty-print in nice columns

* FEATURES
** TODO implement single file ls behavior (eg. `ls ./.emacs`)
** TODO implement -l switch (long format)
** TODO implement -a switch (all nodes)
*** TODO only print non-hidden nodes (only nodes that don't begin with .)
** TODO implement -r switch (print in reverse order)
** TODO implement -R switch (recursive)
** TODO implement color printing

* NOTES
